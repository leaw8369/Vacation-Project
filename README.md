# Vacation-Project
Vacation Final Project
I created this website for a course from Wilmington University titled CSC 100 Web Applications Development. This is my final project for the course. I used CSS, Jss and HTML to create the website. I was required to create a website answering the follow questions:

If you could take a vacation, where would you go? What would you do? What food would you eat? Add images to this webpage after each paragraph tag to share your perfect trip. 

Where would you go?
What would you do?
What would you eat?
